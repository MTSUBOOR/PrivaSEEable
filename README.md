# PrivaSEEable
A chrome extension that obscures on-screen text from potential "shoulder-surfers"

It's a chrome extension that was built to maintain a user’s privacy in public settings.
My team and I used Javascript to create this chrome extension that takes advantage of CSS elements to maintain user privacy
by obscuring their screen’s text from potential onlookers. We implemented a “blur” feature that allows the user to blur onscreen
text and seletively unblur text by holding shift and clicking on a piece of text. We implemented a “scramble” feature as well
which inserts random words in between onscreen text.

PrivaSEEable at it's core is an immediate solution to privacy, that concerns every person who uses technology in public. 
Most people don't necessarily understand cryptocurrency, nor is it widely used yet, end to end encryption and how it keeps
them safe. We don't deny that these are the technologies of the future, and will help shape what privacy and security will
look like moving forward, but the average person will not want to go out of their way to learn, and use a solution for
a problem they don't understand. PrivaSEEable acts as a filter from the prying eyes of all those around us, that we all
feel gazing at us and out screens as we try to orient and navigate in this digital age. We will continue to add more options
for filters to your text on your screens, so that users can pick between options that allow them to read their private
text, but not strangers. As well as adding more customization, so that the user can be more comfortable to these filters,
and it would increase the discomfort that the "peepers" feel when trying to invade your privacy.
